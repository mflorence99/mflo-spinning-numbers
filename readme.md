# Polymer Element: Calculator-like Display Animated with Spinning Numbers
`mflo-spinning-numbers` is a Polymer element that displays an integer number, calculator-fashion and with a spinning animation effect as if the value represent was being calculated in the background. It was inspired by [Harry's] ([http://stackoverflow.com/users/2606013/harry](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2606013/harry)) excellent response to a recent [stack_overflow_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27956723/css-animation-number-increment-effect) question.

## How to Use
The element contains a single, read/write `value` property which optionally can be set initially:

```html
<mflo-spinning-numbers value="1234">
</mflo-spinning-numbers>
```

Additionally, `value` can be set programmatically:

```javascript
var spinner = document.querySelector("mflo-spinning-numbers#the-right-one");
spinner.value = 1234;
```

The animation effect is triggered whenever `value` is set. If no `value` is set initially, the element displays as blank.

## How to Style
Style `mflo-spinning-numbers` as required by defining `--mflo-spinning-numbers-theme` as show below. Here the numbers are styled as green on a black background:

```css
mflo-spinning-numbers {
  --mflo-spinning-numbers-theme: {
    background-color: black;
    color: lightgreen;
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 32px;
    min-width: 280px;
  };
}
```

If you are styling `mflo-spinning-numbers` from the local DOM, be sure to use `custom-style` to enclose your CSS. A simple `<style>` tag will not work, as discussed in the Polymer documentation under [Custom element for document styling](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html).

``` html
<style is="custom-style">
  mflo-spinning-numbers { ... }
</style>
```

## Limitations
Currently, only integers can be shown. A `value` is stripped of all characters other than `[0-9]` as it is applied.
